📘 **Past Tense (Direct Past Tense - “-di’li Geçmiş Zaman”)**

📌 **1. What is the Past Tense?**
The past tense describes events that **already happened**.
In English, it usually corresponds to the **Past Simple**:

*went, did, saw, ate,* etc.

---

🔧 **2. Past Tense Suffix: -dı / -di / -du / -dü / -tı / -ti / -tu / -tü**
This suffix changes depending on the **last sound of the verb**.
➡️ So, again there’s **vowel harmony** and **consonant hardening**.

---

🔤 **3. Vowel Harmony (a, e, ı, i, o, ö, u, ü)**

| Last vowel | Suffix    | Example                          |
| ---------- | --------- | -------------------------------- |
| a, ı       | -dı / -tı | baktı *(looked)*, aldı *(took)*  |
| e, i       | -di / -ti | geldi *(came)*, bildi *(knew)*   |
| o, u       | -du / -tu | okudu *(read)*, tuttu *(held)*   |
| ö, ü       | -dü / -tü | gördü *(saw)*, güldü *(laughed)* |

🔁 If the last consonant is a **hard consonant** (ç, f, h, k, p, s, ş, t), it takes **-tı, -ti, -tu, -tü**.
If it’s a **soft consonant**, it takes **-dı, -di, -du, -dü**.

👤 **4. Personal Endings (I, You, He/She…)**

| Person       | Verb: gelmek (to come) |
| ------------ | ---------------------- |
| I            | geldim *(I came)*      |
| You          | geldin *(You came)*    |
| He/She       | geldi *(He/She came)*  |
| We           | geldik *(We came)*     |
| You (plural) | geldiniz *(You came)*  |
| They         | geldiler *(They came)* |

---

🧠 **Easy Logic:**
**Verb + past tense suffix + personal ending**

Examples:

* gel + di + m → **geldim** *(I came)*
* git + ti + n → **gittin** *(You went)*
* oku + du + k → **okuduk** *(We read)*
